# visual-argument-2023spring
A rhetorical collage assignment for Benjamin Miller's course in [Composing Digital Media](https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring/)

Details:

For this assignment, I chose to do a visual argument piece on the status of Disney, specifically looking at the increases in costs per ticket for going to one of their
amusement parks (Disney Land and/or Disney World). In this piece, I wanted to highlight the duality of Disney Land because its continuously increased in price almost
yearly for the past 3-5 years now and I felt that as a piece that is marketed as a destination of awe and wonder, it definitely cost a pretty penny, and more for most
nowadays regardless of your location, whether you live near one of the parks or not, it seems more like an investment than a simple purchase. The message that I hope
my picture gets across is that for most people that are struggling financially Disney Land/World isn't something of a simple plan to go to nowadays, and that it feels
like its more geared towards the wealth now.
