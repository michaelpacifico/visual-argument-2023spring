# visual-argument-2023spring
A rhetorical collage assignment for Benjamin Miller's course in [Composing Digital Media](https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring/)

VERSION #1 - Details:

For this assignment, I chose to do a visual argument piece on the status of Disney, specifically looking at the increases in costs per ticket for going to one of their amusement parks (Disney Land and/or Disney World). In this piece, I wanted to highlight the duality of Disney Land because its continuously increased in price almost yearly for the past 3-5 years now and I felt that as a piece that is marketed as a destination of awe and wonder, it definitely cost a pretty penny, and more for most nowadays regardless of your location, whether you live near one of the parks or not, it seems more like an investment than a simple purchase. The message that I hope my picture gets across is that for most people that are struggling financially Disney Land/World isn't something of a simple plan to go to nowadays, and that it feels like its more geared towards the wealth now. In the photo, you'll see Mickey Mouse the quintessential mascot of anything Disney related, with glimpses of money in his eyes, the perceived idea that with the recent inflation hits and the rising on ticket prices, they'll be making so much more money that "they" ever imagined. On the left side, I included a photo of one of the Disney locations, where the kingdom is seen and everything is looking magical. On the right side, I included a photo of an empty wallet because if you wanna achieve the experience of a lifetime seen on the left, you'll have to fork over all your money to get to it. This shows off the duality of the situation of inflation for anyone looking towards going to Disney because it's a wonderful experience, but it'll cost you everything.


VERSION #2 - Details:

For the second iteration of the visual argument piece, I decided to work on the eyes of the photo to show more emotion. Initially, I wanted them to be more green because money and I thought that it would emphasize the desire of more money, but given the colors that are already included in the piece I decided against it because it was looking more Christmas-themed because of the green and red tones of the clothing so I just went with more red to show more aggression through inflation. I also added text to the ears which help with what is being referenced from the faded images that are on the left and right of Mickey. I added text to the image to help with filling in the empty space towards the ears. The reason why I chose to overlay the image with a crumpled paper look is because I thought it looked cool and also I felt that it would mesh well with the theme of money, paper, the idea of spending/cost like the image is saying your throwing your money away. Although I like the image without text I think for the sake of the project and guiding the idea for others to see I should include text even if I think it kind of takes away from the image a little.
