# visual-argument-2023spring
A rhetorical collage assignment for Benjamin Miller's course in [Composing Digital Media](https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring/)

VERSION #1 - Details:

For this assignment, I chose to do a visual argument piece on the status of Disney, specifically looking at the increases in costs per ticket for going to one of their
amusement parks (Disney Land and/or Disney World). In this piece, I wanted to highlight the duality of Disney Land because its continuously increased in price almost
yearly for the past 3-5 years now and I felt that as a piece that is marketed as a destination of awe and wonder, it definitely cost a pretty penny, and more for most
nowadays regardless of your location, whether you live near one of the parks or not, it seems more like an investment than a simple purchase.
The message that I hope my picture gets across is that for most people that are struggling financially Disney Land/World isn't something of a simple plan to go to nowadays, and that it feels like its more geared towards the wealth now. In the photo, you'll see Mickey Mouse the quintessential mascot of anything Disney related, with glimpses of money in his eyes, the perceived idea that with the recent inflation hits and the rising on ticket prices, they'll be making so much more money that "they" ever imagined. 
On the left side, I included a photo of one of the Disney locations, where the kingdom is seen and everything is looking magical. 
On the right side, I included a photo of an empty wallet because if you wanna achieve the experience of a lifetime seen on the left, you'll have to fork over all your
money to get to it.
This shows off the duality of the situation of inflation for anyone looking towards going to Disney because it's a wonderful experience, but it'll cost you everything.
Some of the details that I added to reinforce the idea of money and inflation is I put some quotes that I found that are famous quotes about Disney or Mickey Mouse, and 
I changed them to fit the theme of money and what something cost.
Finally, I have both the left and right side faded-in with a gradient map to make it seem like conflicting thoughts, and added a paper crinkle overlay because I thought
it would look cool.
